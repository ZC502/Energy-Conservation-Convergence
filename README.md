# Energy-Conservation-Convergence
This code runs a simulation, records kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE), and checks whether the total energy deviation is within the tolerance (energy conservation). It also checks the convergence of the trajectory (whether the joint velocity tends to zero, indicating stability).
